## IEEE SA WG - P3120 [Standard for Quantum Computing Architecture]

This standard defines a technical architecture for quantum computers. Features and characteristics of the architecture are based on quantum qubit modalities (e.g., superconducting, neutral atoms, trapped ions, photonic, NV centers), and mode of operations (e.g., digital and analog). The defined architectures include the hardware (e.g., signal generator), low-level software (e.g., quantum error correction) components, and programming method (description of quantum circuits, description of Hamiltonian evolution) of such architectures.

## IEEE SA WG - P3348 [Recommended Practice for the Framework and Evaluation Methods of Two-Dimensional (2D) Real-Person Digital Clothes Model Generation System Based on Artificial Intelligence]

This standard defines a framework including requirements and evaluation methods for a two-dimensional (2D) real-person digital clothes model generation system using artificial intelligence (AI). In the standard, the framework includes functional modules and the input/output interfaces of the 2D real-person digital clothes model generation system. The input interface includes pictures of the clothes to be presented, clothes measurements, and model types. The output interface provides a mechanism to export images of the generated models in clothes and multiple postures. The framework includes modules for digital model face generation, clothes generation, digital model posture generation, and image fusion. Methods for evaluating the generated 2D real-person digital clothes models are also specified in this standard.

## IEEE SA WG - P3514 [Recommended Practice for Levels of Artificial Intelligence Capabilities for AI Entities and Applications]

This recommended practice defines levels of capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The capability levels can be used to classify AI entities after benchmarking and evaluation. Evaluation criteria and specific benchmarks are provided for common capabilities per typical application scenarios/domains (e.g., AI used in a personal computer, in a mobile phone, or by robots).

## IEEE SA WG - P62659 [Standard for Nanomanufacturing -- Large Scale Manufacturing for Nanoelectronics]

This International Standard provides a framework for introducing nanoelectronics into large scale, high volume production in semiconductor manufacturing facilities through the incorporation of nanomaterials (e.g. carbon nanotubes, graphene, quantum dots, etc.). Since semiconductor manufacturing facilities need to incorporate practices that maintain high yields, there are very strict requirements for how manufacturing is performed. Nanomaterials represent a potential contaminant in semiconductor manufacturing facilities and need to be introduced in a structured and methodical way. This International Standard provides steps employed to facilitate the introduction of nanomaterials into the semiconductor manufacturing facilities. This sequence is described under the areas of raw materials acquisition, materials processing, design, integrated circuits (IC) fabrication, testing, and end-use. These activities represent the major stages of the supply chain in semiconductor manufacturing facilities.
